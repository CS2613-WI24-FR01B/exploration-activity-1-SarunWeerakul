## MovingText Program

### 1. Demonstrated Package/Library
   The sample program demonstrates the usage of the tkinter library, which is 
a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit in Python.

### 2. Running the Program
   To run the program:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided file, _pyea1.py_, to your directory or copy the code from this file
   into a Python file, for example, moving_text.py.
3. Execute the Python file using the command python pyea1.py or python <file_name.py>
   in your terminal.
   
### 3. Purpose of the Program
   The program serves the purpose of displaying a moving text animation in a GUI window.
It allows users to view a predefined text ("Happy Valentine's Day!") moving horizontally
across the window continuously. Additionally, it provides functionality to edit
the displayed text through an input tab.

### 4. Sample Input/Output
  __Sample Input:__
   User can input a new text in the text entry field provided in the _"Text"_ tab.
After entering the desired text, the user clicks the _"Edit"_ button to update
the displayed text.
  
  __Sample Output:__
   Initially, the program displays the text "Happy Valentine's Day!" moving horizontally
across the window.
   If the user edits the text to "Welcome to CS2613" and clicks the "Edit" button,
the displayed text will change accordingly, and the animation will continue with
the updated text.
   The text continues to move from right to left until the program is closed.
This program provides a simple interactive interface for displaying and editing text in
a graphical environment.
